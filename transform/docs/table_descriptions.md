# Summary: stg_claims

Staging of claims is just renaming of the input data. This to get a consistent naming throughout the project.

If the data is taken from Skuld DWH, the naming should already be consitent and IT should be contacted if this is not the case.  

For renaming that is specified for a single purpose, for instance Solvency, this should be done in report tables at the very end.

# Summary: int_claims

Intermediate claims is based on stg_claims and have primary keys that makes it easy to know graunlarity 
and join with premiums to create the final fct_insurance.

The granularity of the data is determined by the 'pk_columns' variable, which includes 
"product_line_id", "business_unit_id", "accident_date", and "development_date". Each unique 
combination of these columns forms a distinct record in the 'claim_data' table.

Two types of keys are generated for each record:
1. 'primary_key': This is a surrogate key generated by hashing the values of the columns specified 
   in the 'pk_columns' variable. This key is unique for each record and doesn't have any business 
   meaning.
2. 'business_key': This is a natural key created by concatenating the values of the columns 
   specified in the 'pk_columns' variable. This key has business meaning and can be used to 
   identify records in a way that makes sense to the business.

The final output is a table that includes the generated keys along with all the columns from the 
source table.
