# Summary: stg_claims

Staging of claims is just renaming of the input data. This to get a consistent naming throughout the project.

If the data is taken from Skuld DWH, the naming should already be consitent and IT should be contacted if this is not the case.  

For renaming that is specified for a single purpose, for instance Solvency, this should be done in report tables at the very end.
